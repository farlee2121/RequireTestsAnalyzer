# RequireTestsAnalyzer

A nice experiement, and it would still be nice to run this analyzer locally without running tests. However, [coverlet](https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet) can be used to check every method is tested

coverlet can even be installed as a dotnet tool https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet
